# Car Evaluation with Machine Learning  

## Project Overview  
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify cars based on their attributes using the **Car Evaluation Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation). The goal is to predict whether a car falls into one of four categories: **unacceptable, acceptable, good, or very good**.  

### **Key Features**
- **Explores multiple ML models**: Decision Tree, k-NN, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and SVM.
- **Handles ordinal data**: One-Hot Encoding used to preserve categorical distinctions.
- **Imbalanced dataset solutions**: MCC included for robust performance tracking.
- **Nested Cross-Validation**: 5-fold stratified inner/outer loops to ensure reliable model selection.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV applied for optimal parameter selection.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, MCC, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC analysis.
- **Final Model Selection**: SVM demonstrated the highest classification performance.

## **Final Performance on Test Set**
| Class  | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| acc    | 97.96%   | 100%   | 98.97%   |
| good   | 100%     | 100%   | 100%     |
| unacc  | 100%     | 100%   | 100%     |
| vgood  | 100%     | 87.5%  | 93.33%   |

- **Overall Accuracy**: 99.54%  
- **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**: 0.9899  

---

## **ROC Curve Analysis**
- **AUC for all classes is near 1**, confirming strong separation ability.
- **"vgood" class has a slightly lower AUC (~0.95)** due to its lower representation.
- **SVM demonstrated the best ROC performance**, making it the most reliable classifier.
- **Each class exhibits smooth ROC curves**, indicating minimal misclassification.
